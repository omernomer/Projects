<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><strong class="note">Note</strong>: Different operating system families have different line-ending conventions. When you write a text file and want to insert a line break, you need to use the correct line-ending character(s) for your operating system. Unix based systems use <em>\n</em> as the line ending character, Windows based systems use <em>\r\n</em> as the line ending characters and Macintosh based systems use <em>\r</em> as the line ending character. </span><br /><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">If you use the wrong line ending characters when writing your files, you might find that other applications that open those files will "look funny".&nbsp;</span></p>
